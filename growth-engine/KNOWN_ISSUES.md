## ISSUE-001 — Cloudflare managed challenge blocks ALL crawlers  [CRITICAL · RESOLVED 2026-10-11]

- **Evidence (before):** 2026-10-07 → 2026-10-11, every path (`/`,
  `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/llms.txt`, `/index.html`,
  `/services/leak-detection.html`, `/cities/laguna-niguel.html`) returned
  `HTTP/2 403` with header `cf-mitigated: challenge`, for Googlebot, Bingbot,
  GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Applebot and plain curl.
- **Root cause (confirmed via Cloudflare API):** zone
  `straightflushplumbingoc.com` (id `0e9dba51558951ac91fadb2c0e28abde`) had
  **Under Attack mode ON** — `security_level = "under_attack"` since
  `2026-09-20T20:04:22Z`. Bot Fight Mode was **off**.
- **Fix applied 2026-10-11T07:27:51Z:**
  `PATCH /zones/{id}/settings/security_level` → `{"value": "medium"}`.
  Narrowest possible change; nothing else modified. Reversible with one call.
- **Verification 2026-10-11T07:28:05Z:** all 8 UAs and every path above return
  **200 with no `cf-mitigated` header**.
- **Follow-up (medium):** the AI-readable files (`/llms-full.txt`, `/md/**`)
  still return **404** until PR #24 is merged — that is a deploy step, not a
  Cloudflare issue.
- **Approval:** Level 3 (hosting/security config). Applied by agent with the
  owner-supplied Cloudflare API token and explicit request.
- **Status:** **RESOLVED.** See `growth-engine/CLOUDFLARE_CRAWLER_READINESS.md`.
  Regression check: `bash growth-engine/tests/crawler_access_check.sh`.

## ISSUE-002 — Self-reported `aggregateRating` in LocalBusiness JSON-LD  [MEDIUM · OPEN]

- **Evidence:** `index.html` JSON-LD contains `aggregateRating` (4.8/74) and
  `review` on a `Plumber` type.
- **Impact:** Google's structured-data policy: review/rating markup must be
  genuinely independent and about the entity; self-serving ratings on a business
  may be ignored or flagged. Low risk but a hygiene item.
- **Fix (proposed, evidence-gated):** confirm the rating matches the live Yelp/
  Google profiles; consider moving ratings to a verified third-party reference or
  removing if not corroborated. See `proposals/`.
- **Approval:** Level 2 (metadata/content using verified facts) once corroborated.

---

## ISSUE-003 — Duplicate open PRs (draft content not merged)  [LOW · OPEN]

- **Evidence:** PRs #15, #16, #17, #18 all open; #16 and #17 touch overlapping
  leak-detection FAQ/schema changes.
- **Impact:** review noise; potential conflicting edits if merged blindly.
- **Fix:** owner/Implementer reviews and merges the best version of each, closes
  duplicates. Not blocking.
- **Approval:** Level 2.

---

## ISSUE-004 — Stale PR #11 and committed `.git-2/`  [LOW · OPEN]

- **Evidence:** PR #11 stale since 2026-09-28, `mergeable=false`, ~10k lines of
  unrelated churn including a committed `.git-2/` object store.
- **Impact:** repo hygiene / confusion.
- **Fix:** close PR #11; re-land wanted pieces in small PRs. Not blocking.
- **Approval:** Level 2.

## ISSUE-005 — Duplicate automation coverage  [LOW · CONSOLIDATED 2026-10-12]

- **Evidence:** "Strategist: Daily SEO Action Plan" (06:30 PT), "Scout: Daily
  Competitor Intel" (05:30 PT) and "Sentinel" retry overlap in scope; Automation A
  ("Morning AI Search Visibility", 06:00 PT) overlapped the new Intelligence HQ
  daily job at the same slot.
- **Impact:** redundancy/token cost; possible conflicting changes.
- **Fix (in progress):** the owner's Intelligence HQ replaces Automation A.
  `SFPL Intelligence HQ Daily 6 AM` (`0 6 * * *`) + `SFPL Intelligence HQ Weekly
  Review` (`0 6 * * 1`) were created 2026-10-12; **Automation A was disabled** to
  avoid two overlapping 06:00 PT runs.
- **Consolidation completed 2026-10-12 (Phase 2):** the three legacy agents were
  **disabled** — `Scout: Daily Competitor Intel` (`30 5 * * *`),
  `Strategist: Daily SEO Action Plan` (`30 6 * * *`), and
  `Sentinel: Scout Auto-Retry` (`30 7,11 * * *`). HQ-D (daily) + HQ-W (weekly) are
  now the only active intelligence loops. Only one automation occupies the 06:00 PT
  slot.
- **Approval:** Level 2 (automation config).

## ISSUE-006 — Automation run budget: open-ended research times out before commit  [MEDIUM · MITIGATED 2026-10-12]

- **Evidence:** the first manual dispatch of `SFPL Intelligence HQ Daily 6 AM`
  (run `897c5d5a-6143-4133-a0e4-8501d62f0206`, 2026-10-12 05:33–06:06 UTC) returned
  `status: FAILED`, `error_detail: "Timed out: command timed out or was killed"`.
  The run spent its whole budget exploring many search engines (Yahoo, Bing RSS,
  Marginalia, headless Chromium, Google SERP pacing, blog crawls) and never reached
  the write/commit step, so **no report was persisted** — exactly the failure mode
  the spec warns about.
- **Impact:** a run that researches forever produces nothing durable; the daily loop
  can silently produce no output.
- **Constraint discovered:** the automation API caps `timeout` at **1800 s**
  (30 min); a longer timeout is rejected with HTTP 422
  (`timeout must not exceed 1800 seconds`).
- **Fix applied 2026-10-12:** the daily prompt now carries a **mandatory time
  budget** (≈40% research / 60% write+commit), limits search to **Brave** (+ at most
  one alternate), forbids headless browsers and multi-engine probing, and instructs
  the agent to **stop researching and commit** when near budget. The weekly prompt
  got the same budget note.
- **Verified 2026-10-13:** the budget fix works. The daily run stayed inside budget
  (the scheduled cron run `1afcbefd` finished in ~10 min) and persisted its output.
- **Approval:** Level 2 (automation prompt config).

## ISSUE-007 — Search providers block the sweep egress IP  [MEDIUM · MITIGATED 2026-10-13]

- **Evidence:** Brave Search returns **HTTP 429** to this egress IP; DuckDuckGo HTML
  returns **202**; multiple daily runs recorded the sweep returning no comparable
  results because the primary provider was blocked. Only **DuckDuckGo Lite**
  (`https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/`) has returned parseable results (36/36 on
  2026-10-12).
- **Impact:** a run can burn budget retrying a blocked provider and return thin
  evidence; the "visibility" time series is then inconsistent across providers.
- **Fix applied 2026-10-13:** the daily prompt now defines an explicit provider
  order (**Brave → DuckDuckGo Lite → Bing**), falls through **once** on 429/202, and
  records the provider used (`platform`) per row so cross-run comparisons stay honest.
- **Residual:** this is an external rate-limit, not fixable from the repo. A paid
  SERP API or a Perplexity key (P-002) would give a stable, attributable signal.
- **Approval:** Level 1/2 (prompt config).

## ISSUE-008 — Other automation sessions mutate the same repo/branch concurrently  [LOW · OPEN]

- **Evidence:** during the 2026-10-12 setup, a concurrent automated run pushed the
  same daily branch and opened PR #30; a separate "Phase 2" session opened PR #31;
  the owner merged #30/#29/#31 within minutes of each other. My setup branch was
  superseded while still open.
- **Impact:** duplicate/overlapping PRs and branch conflicts; wasted effort; risk of
  confusing the audit trail.
- **Mitigation (in use):** conflict-safe rebase-before-push; union-merge append-only
  data; one PR per day's work; the daily prompt opens PRs to `main` and never
  self-merges. **Before doing repo work, always `git fetch` and check for a newer
  `main` and for open PRs on the target branch.**
- **Approval:** informational.
