# Experiment Log — Straight Flush Growth Engine

One entry per experiment. Raw rows in `data/content_experiments.jsonl`.
Distinguish genuine trends from normal AI-answer variability: repeat tests on
fixed query wording before declaring a trend. Never attribute an AI-recommendation
change to a website edit without sufficient evidence.

## exp-2026-10-07-schema-orphans — schema + de-orphan city pages
- **Hypothesis:** BreadcrumbList/FAQPage schema and de-orphaning 3 city pages
  improve crawl discovery and rich-result eligibility.
- **Evidence:** `briefs/strategy-log.md` 2026-10-07.
- **Change:** schema + internal links + sitemap hub URLs. PR #14.
- **Baseline:** 0 indexable orphans after change; schema coverage partial.
- **Follow-up:** 2026-10-14, 2026-11-07.
- **Result:** pending.
- **Confounder (decisive):** Cloudflare returns 403 to all crawlers → no SERP
  or AI-search effect can be measured until lifted.
- **Confidence:** low. **Decision:** keep.

## exp-2026-10-09-cloudflare-crawler-access — (proposed, needs owner action)
- **Hypothesis:** ~100% of the site's organic/AI discoverability is currently
  suppressed by the Cloudflare managed challenge; lifting it restores crawl
  access and is the single highest-impact change available.
- **Evidence:** live 403 `cf-mitigated: challenge` to 7 crawler UAs + curl on
  all paths, 2026-10-09 (`data/technical_health_history.jsonl`); independently
  logged 2026-10-07 in `briefs/strategy-log.md`.
- **Change:** owner applies Cloudflare settings per `CLOUDFLARE-SETUP.md` §2a–2c.
  **Not a repo change** — cannot be executed autonomously (hosting/DNS = Level 3).
- **Baseline metric:** crawler-accessible pages = 0; 403 rate = 100%.
- **Follow-up:** re-run `/tmp` crawler check after owner confirms; expect 200
  and no `cf-mitigated` header.
- **Confidence:** high. **Decision:** escalate to owner (see `proposals/`).
